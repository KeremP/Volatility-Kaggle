# Volatility-Kaggle
Development repo for Optiver Realized Vol Prediction Kaggle competition.

# PyTorch Baselines
- Initial baseline: trained shallow MLP. Decent results w/ RMSPE @ ~.35
- Transformer baseline: trained transformer architecture. Vol is typically localized - transformer may be able to learn this locality wrt attention weights.
